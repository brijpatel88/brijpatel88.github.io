      <h1>👨‍💻 About Me</h1>
      <p>I’m Brijesh Patel — a passionate web developer, graphic designer, and mobile app creator based in Canada. I specialize in crafting engaging digital experiences using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m constantly expanding my skills in frontend interactivity and responsive design.</p>
      <p>My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and creativity. I enjoy bringing ideas to life — whether it’s through building visually appealing websites, intuitive user interfaces, or dynamic web features. I also have hands-on experience in PHP, Kotlin, Java, Dart (Flutter), and am currently enhancing my JavaScript skills to add more interactivity and animation to my projects.</p>
      <p>Beyond coding, I’m a travel enthusiast and photographer. I love sharing stories through my travel and food blogs, blending my passion for visuals and storytelling into every project I create.</p>

   <h2>📝 Blog 1: What is Responsive Web Design?</h2>
   <h4>Published: July 14, 2025 • By: Brijesh Patel</h4>
   <p>Have you ever opened a website on your phone and it looked messy? That’s what happens when a site isn’t responsive.</p>
   <p>Responsive Web Design means your website adapts to all screen sizes — mobile, tablet, or desktop — without breaking the layout.</p>
   <p>I use tools like CSS Flexbox and Grid to make my designs responsive. It’s a must-have skill for every web developer today!</p>
   <h2>📝 Blog 2: Why I Like Using Flutter for Mobile Apps</h2>
   <h4>Published: July 14, 2025 • By: Brijesh Patel</h4>
   <p>Flutter is one of my favorite tools for mobile app development. It lets me build apps for both Android and iOS using a single codebase written in Dart.</p>
   <p>It’s fast, flexible, and the UI looks amazing. I recently created a small app with a login screen, form validation, and local storage — all done in Flutter!</p>
   <p>If you’re just starting with apps, give Flutter a try.</p>
